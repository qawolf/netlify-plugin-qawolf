# netlify-plugin-qawolf

A Netlify plugin is no longer required to run [QA Wolf](https://www.qawolf.com/) tests after successful Netlify deployments. Refer to [the documentation](https://www.qawolf.com/docs/run-tests-on-netlify-deployment) for instructions on setting up a webhook notification instead.
